<h1>The Best Movies According to Eliza</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ever After</h3>
<p>I am a sucker for a good Rom Com. I love the setting and storyline.</p>
<h3>Land Before Time</h3>
<p>My absolute favorite movie when I was younger. Now that I have children, it still makes the list.</p>
<h3>The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>Not everyone's cup of tea, but my husband introduced me and it is ridiculously silly and I love it.</p>
